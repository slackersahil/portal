Student violence
In April 2011, during a football game a student was beaten by opposition team members and died a few hours later in hospital. The beaten student was from Mizoram and the three accused were Sudanese and Tanzanian. The racial aspect of the crime led to near-rioting on the campus by students, destroying a number of kiosks and cars. Tension continued with the university closed for three days, and with police being pelted with stones by angry students. LPU Pro-Chancellor Rashmi Mittal described the attack as, "students didnâ€™t take the spirit of the game in a positive manner". The university's management have also been criticised for ignoring earlier and later racial attacks.
